# Boosting Self-Supervised Dataset Distillation via Approximation

A faithful implementation of the paper "Boosting Self-Supervised Dataset Distillation via Approximation" which presents a novel approach to dataset distillation using self-supervised learning instead of supervised learning.

## Overview

This implementation introduces:
- **Self-supervised dataset distillation** using representation learning
- **Approximation networks** to efficiently handle data augmentations
- **Low-rank factorization** for compact dataset representation
- **Comprehensive evaluation protocol** following SSL standards

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy scikit-learn tqdm pyyaml psutil
```

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aayush75/boost-self-supervised-dataset-distillation.git
cd boost-self-supervised-dataset-distillation
```

### Step 2: Directory Structure

The repository will create the following structure:
```

├── configs/
│   └── cifar100.yaml
├── data/                          # CIFAR100 will be downloaded here
├── teacher_models/                # Teacher models saved here
├── distilled_assets/              # Distilled datasets saved here
├── evaluation_models/             # Evaluation models saved here
├── main_distill.py               # Main distillation script
├── main_evaluate.py              # Evaluation script
├── train_teacher.py              # Teacher model training
├── run_comprehensive_evaluation.py # Complete evaluation pipeline
├── models.py                     # Model architectures
├── utils.py                      # Utility functions
└── health_check.py               # Implementation verification
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

```bash
python health_check.py
```

This checks all dependencies and verifies the implementation integrity.

### Step 4: Train Teacher Model (Required)

Train a self-supervised teacher model using Barlow Twins:

```bash
python train_teacher.py
```

This will:
- Download CIFAR100 dataset automatically
- Train a ResNet18 using Barlow Twins self-supervised learning
- Save the teacher model to `teacher_models/resnet18_barlow_twins_cifar100.pth`
- Training takes approximately 2-3 hours on GPU

### Step 5: Dataset Distillation

Run the main distillation process:

```bash
python main_distill.py
```

This will:
- Load the trained teacher model
- Initialize distilled dataset parameters using PCA
- Train approximation networks for all augmentations
- Perform alternating optimization for 30,000 steps
- Save distilled assets to `distilled_assets/cifar100_N100/`

**Expected Output:**
```
Initializing distilled data parameters
Performing PCA to find 200 components....
PCA fitting complete
Projecting rotation representations: 100%
Projecting color jitter representations: 100%
Projecting gaussian blur representations: 100%

Training Approximation Networks
Training Approximation Net for rot_90: 100%|████████| 500/500
...
Distillation complete. Assets saved to: ./distilled_assets/cifar100_N100
```

### Step 6: Evaluation

Run comprehensive evaluation:

```bash
python main_evaluate.py
```

Or for statistical significance with multiple runs:

```bash
python run_comprehensive_evaluation.py --runs 3
```

**Expected Results:**
```

## Configuration

The main configuration file is `configs/cifar100.yaml`. Key parameters:

### Dataset Parameters
```yaml
distillation:
  storage_budget_N: 100           # Number of distilled images
  num_distilled_images_m: 100     # Same as storage_budget_N
  steps: 30000                    # Distillation optimization steps

parametrization:
  image_bases_U: 200              # Image basis dimension
  repr_bases_V: 200               # Representation basis dimension
  image_basis_size: 16            # Low-resolution image size
```

### Augmentation Strategy
```yaml

  rotate: [90, 180, 270]          # Rotation angles
  color_jitter:                   # ColorJitter parameters
    brightness: 0.4

```

  linear_eval_lr: 0.2             # Linear evaluation learning rate
```

## Implementation Details

### Core Algorithm

The implementation follows the paper's methodology:

1. **Low-rank Factorization**: Images and representations are parameterized as:
   ```
   X = B_x @ C_x^T
   Y = B_y @ C_y^T
   ```

2. **Self-supervised Loss**: Uses MSE loss between predicted and teacher representations:
   ```python
   loss = F.mse_loss(student_repr, teacher_repr)
   ```

3. **Approximation Networks**: MLPs approximate augmentation effects:
   ```python
   augmented_repr = base_repr + approximation_mlp(base_repr)
   ```

### Augmentation Strategy

Complete implementation includes:
- **Rotation**: 90°, 180°, 270°
- **Color Jitter**: Brightness, contrast, saturation, hue variations
- **Random Crops**: Multi-scale cropping
- **Gaussian Blur**: Multiple kernel sizes
- **Horizontal Flip**: Random horizontal flipping

### Evaluation Protocol

Follows standard SSL evaluation:
1. **Freeze** trained feature extractor
2. **Train** only linear classifier on top
3. **Evaluate** on test set
4. **Compare** with full dataset baseline

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Dataset

To use with a different dataset, modify `utils.py`:

```python
def get_dataset(name, data_dir='./data'):
    if name.upper() == "YOUR_DATASET":
        # Implement dataset loading
        pass
```

Update the config file accordingly.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

Key hyperparameters to tune:
- `storage_budget_N`: Number of distilled images
- `image_bases_U`, `repr_bases_V`: Basis dimensions
- `approximation_mlp.hidden_dim`: MLP capacity
- `distillation.steps`: Optimization iterations

### Multi-GPU Training

For faster training, modify the device setup:

```python
if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
    model = nn.DataParallel(model)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Teacher model not found**:
   ```bash
   python train_teacher.py
   ```

2. **CUDA out of memory**:
   - Reduce `batch_size` in config
   - Reduce `storage_budget_N`

3. **Low accuracy retention**:
   - Increase `distillation.steps`
   - Tune `approximation_mlp.hidden_dim`
   - Check teacher model quality

### Verification

Run the health check to verify installation:
```bash
python health_check.py
```

Expected output should show all checks passing.
